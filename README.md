# svg THREE D model
Easily convert your svg images into 3D models,
you'll be needing two svg images corresponding respectively to the front and the side of your model.
Solids on the same plane need to be grouped by colour, please refrain from using the `<style>` tag, 
use instead the `fill` attribute on every path.
